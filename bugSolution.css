The solution involves carefully considering CSS specificity and ensuring that selectors are ordered appropriately to achieve the desired styling. One approach is to use more specific selectors (like IDs) sparingly and prioritize class selectors for better maintainability and predictability. Alternatively, you can reorganize your selectors or use the `!important` flag (although this is generally discouraged due to its potential for creating hard-to-maintain code). In this solution, we've updated the selectors to ensure that the styles are applied as intended, avoiding specificity conflicts.
