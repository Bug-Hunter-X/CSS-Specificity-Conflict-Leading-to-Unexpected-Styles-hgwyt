This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue involving specificity conflicts.  The `bug.css` file contains code that shows how more specific selectors (such as ID selectors) can override less specific selectors (such as class selectors), even if the less specific selector appears later in the stylesheet. This can lead to unexpected visual results.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution to this problem by clarifying the selectors used and ensuring that the desired styles are applied correctly. See the files for more details.
